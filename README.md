Yet another MQTT garden/farm hydration system

This system allows ESP32 (And eventually ESP8266) microcontrollers to automate the hydration, fertilization, and monitorring functions of your garden with the capability to transmit data to an MQTT broker of your choosing (We like MOSQUITTO), and have that data read by the Home Automation controller or Data Visualization controller of your choice.

We believe that using robotics to control fluid transfer inside a garden has the potential to save precious water, a key component in reducing argicultural operating costs for (currently) small scale gardeners and botanists. 

A myriad of non-profit organizations believe that we are currently inside of, or are entering a water crisis. We believe that technology can help mitigate that, especially when made open source and available to all - thanks to low cost publically available microcontroller systems that can be powered by small solar panels, PoE, USB, or any other method capable of delivering 5 volts.
